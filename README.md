*Unix watch(1) in the browser.*

The Unix/Linux program "watch" runs a program of your choosing repeatedly,
displaying its output on the screen each time.  wswatch is like that, but it
renders the output in any number of connected web browers via WebSockets (or
another fallback mechanism if necessary).
